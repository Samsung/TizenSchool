# Overview

## Overview

This tutorial explains how to use Tizen Peripheral I2C C# API. [I2C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C) stands for Inter-Integrated Circuit and is a serial bi-directional communication bus, widely used for transferring data between electronic devices.



The application communicates with Accelerometer device (ADXL345) via I2C bus to read measured acceleration along 3 axes.



[ADXL345 Specification](http://https:\www.sparkfun.com\datasheets\Sensors\Accelerometer\ADXL345.pdf)



## Requirements

To make use of this tutorial, it is required to be familiar with C# basics as well as having a configured environment ([Getting started with Raspberry PI 3&4](https://tizenschool.org/tutorial/191/contents/1)).



Hardware Requirements:



Software Requirements:



Tizen:

## Circuit

Let's start with connecting the ADXL345 accelerometer to the Raspberry Pi according to the following table.



**_IMPORTANT!_**  Please notice, that 3V3 and 5V pins are located close to each oter and connecting to 5V would be potentially fatally harmful for ADXL345.

# Implementation

## Implementation

The application is a Service Tizen App, created with Visual Studio project wizard. In addition to automatically generated file, it contains following file:

## Accelerometer.cs

The _Accelerometer_  class represents the ADXL345 accelerometer connected via I2C. It contains the logic needed to measure and print the acceleration values.



## Accelerometer_App.cs

The last step is to define the _Accelerometer_  object and controll it in the application.



The _Accelerometer_App.cs_ file contains the _App_  class which controls the application's life cycle.



# Verification

## Verification

The result can be observed in the shell, in the form of logs containting current acceleration value.



To read the logs follow these steps:



And now you should see the logs with current acceleration values from the ADXL345.
