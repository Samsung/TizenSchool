# I. Introduction

## 1. Lottie animation

For recent years, modern UX has become more intuitive and simpler, concept of Micro Interaction has been introduced to various cases in multiple environments. In the meantime, Lottie which was named by AirBnB, came out as a new practical method to concrete those concepts. It's a sort of data format that contains visual shapes and animation metadata.

Basically, this Lottie file is composed by using JSON format, it contains visual shape information such as rectangle, circle, path and fill methods like the traditional vector graphics elements. It sounds same with SVG format but it could contain frame information for smooth animation. It defines various elements, properties and functionalities for constructing any kinds of complex designs and those data is hierarchically well constructed for run-time processing. That's one of major pros of the Lottie file.

The other big pros of the Lottie is that it could be extracted from Adobe After Effect(AE) using Bodymovin plug-in exporter. Since AE is the one of the most popular design tools these days among designers, there are fewer barriers to apply Lottie data to your application Uis if you have developers with interaction designers.

## 2. Lottie On Tizen

In Tizen, you can play the lottie animation with elm_animation_view. elm_animation_view provides a control interface for animation data. It can load, show, and play the animation data, which is a json(Lottie animation file) type. It also provides some controls related to frames.

# II. Create a "Like-Button"

## 1. Prepare button

We will create a “Like button” using Lottie animation.

All we need to make this is a beautifully “Like” animation and Button.

Create a Box where the Button will be located. And create a button to be placed there.

Box –  Button – Animation view contents

“Like” Text

```c
….
Evas_Object * box = elm_box_add(parent);
evas_object_size_hint_weight_set(box, EVAS_HINT_EXPAND, EVAS_HINT_EXPAND);
evas_object_size_hint_align_set(box, EVAS_HINT_FILL, EVAS_HINT_FILL);
evas_object_show(box);

Evas_Object *btn = elm_button_add(box);
evas_object_size_hint_weight_set(btn, EVAS_HINT_EXPAND, EVAS_HINT_EXPAND);
evas_object_size_hint_align_set(btn, EVAS_HINT_FILL, EVAS_HINT_FILL);
evas_object_size_hint_max_set(btn, ELM_SCALE_SIZE(300), ELM_SCALE_SIZE(150));
elm_object_text_set(btn, "Like");
evas_object_show(btn);
….

```

## 2. Make elm_animation_view

Now that the button is ready, it‘s time to play the Lottie animation.

We use the elm_animation_view widget to play the Lottie animation.

This widget is a controller for Lottie animation

elm_animation_view could be created as follows.

```c
Evas_Object *anim_view = elm_animation_view_add(btn);
evas_object_size_hint_weight_set(anim_view, EVAS_HINT_EXPAND, EVAS_HINT_EXPAND);
evas_object_size_hint_align_set(anim_view, EVAS_HINT_FILL, EVAS_HINT_FILL);
evas_object_size_hint_min_set(anim_view, ELM_SCALE_SIZE(125), ELM_SCALE_SIZE(125));

elm_animation_view_file_set(anim_view, /* FILE PATH/like.json */, NULL);
…
elm_object_part_content_set(btn, "icon", anim_view);

```

If elm_animation_view is ready, let's play animation.

**[Note]**

In this tutorial we will download and use the appropriate resources from lottiefiles.com.

(Link : [https://lottiefiles.com/6970-like](https://lottiefiles.com/6970-like))

You can use an appropriate animation resource depending on your scenario.

Please refer to [https://airbnb.design/lottie](https://airbnb.design/lottie) for how to make lottie json file

## 3. Play animation

We will output this animation in the stopped state and play it when the button event occurs.

If the button is already clicked, it will show the rewind animation as for cancel.

```c
Eina_Bool Liked = EINA_FALSE;

static void
_bt_clicked(void *data, Evas_Object *obj EINA_UNUSED, void *event_info EINA_UNUSED)
{
   Evas_Object *anim_view  = (Evas_Object*)data;

   if (Liked)
     {
        elm_animation_view_play_back(anim_view);
        Liked = EINA_FALSE;
     }
   else
     {
        elm_animation_view_play(anim_view);
        Liked = EINA_TRUE;
     }
}

main()
{
   …
   evas_object_smart_callback_add(btn, "clicked", _bt_clicked, anim_view);
   …
}

```

Using these features, you can create UX with various interactions.

You can register callback functions connected to the following signal for elm_animation_view object.

For example, you can do that like below.

```c
static void _play_start_cb(void *data, Evas_Object *obj, void *ev)
{
    // This callback is called when the animation starts.
}

…
evas_object_smart_callback_add(anim_view, “play,start”, _play_start_cb, NULL);
…

```
