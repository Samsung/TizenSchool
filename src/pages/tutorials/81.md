# I. Introduction

## 1. Overview

In this tutorial, we will create a simple application which will use data bindings to create dynamic user interface.

The tutorial is divided into two main chapters:

Main goal of this tutorial is to show how to utilize data bindings. Application "BindingTutorial" will be the result of those instructions.

## 2. How data binding works

**Binding basics**

Data binding brings easy way to update UI of application. It connects two properties of objects so that change in one object causes change in the other. Data bindings can be defined in code or in XAML. This mechanism is very important in MVVM pattern, because it allows to completely separate view from business logic.<br/>In data binding we can distinguish _binding source_  and _binding target_ . Target property should be registered by creating _BindableProperty_ , so it can listen for any changes in source property.

<img src="/TizenSchool/assets/images/tutorials/81/diagram1.png" style="height:213px; width:731px"/>

For example Label has bindable property _Text_  and we have object _Animal_  with string property _Name_ . So _Text_ property is _Target_  and _Name_  is _Source_ .<br/>In data binding we must inform our target properties about changes in sources. Framework provides us with _INotifyPropertyChanged_  interface. This interface contains event that should be fired, when we want to update source property.

**Setting binding**

Binding can be defined in C# code:

```csharp
var sourceObject = new SourceData();
var myBinding = new Binding("MyProperty", BindingMode.OneWay)
{
    Source = sourceObject
};
MyLabel.SetBinding(Label.TextProperty, myBinding);
```

Or in XAML:

```xml
<Label>
    <Label.Text>
        <Binding Path="MyProperty">
            <Binding.Source>
                <local:SourceData />
            </Binding.Source>
        </Binding>
    </Label.Text>
</Label>
```

Setting explicitly source can be ommited by setting **data context** _._ In Xamarin.Forms we can set it by using property _BindingContext._  Data context is object that contains Source property. It can be simple type or class (In fact it doesn't have to be CLR object. XMLs, dynamic objects or entities also can be sources for data binding).  After setting binding context, we have access to its public properties. Binding context is inherited from parent, so if we set binding context for page it will be accessible for whole content of that page.

**Types of binding**

As you can see in examples, while creating binding we used property named Mode of type BindingMode. We used default value, but there are three options, that we can use. Those values indicate direction of data flow. Sometimes we want to let user change some data and propagate it to source object. On the following figure you can observe different direction of data flow.

## 3. Importing and building solution

Now, we will set up a Visual Studio environment for further development.

Step 1: Download and unpack [BindingTutorial.zip](https://tizenschool.org/assets/images/tutorials/81/BindingTutorial_init.zip) \*\*\*\* file.

Step 2: Click File > Open > Project/Solution...

<img src="/TizenSchool/assets/images/tutorials/81/open_project.png" style="border-style:solid; border-width:1px; height:400px; width:682px"/>

Step 3: Go to downloaded directory and select BindingTutorial.sln file (Microsoft Visual Studio Solution), then click the "Open" button.

<img src="/TizenSchool/assets/images/tutorials/81/open_sln.png" style="border-style:solid; border-width:1px; height:499px; width:958px"/>

The solution structure is visible in the Solution Explorer view. It contains two projects: BindingTutorial and BindingTutorial.Tizen

<img src="/TizenSchool/assets/images/tutorials/81/20200219_140322.png" style="border-style:solid; border-width:1px; height:340px; width:316px"/>

Step 4: Build and run application. After right-click on the  **BindingTutorial.Tizen** project, choice a " **set as** **StartUp Project"**

<img src="/TizenSchool/assets/images/tutorials/81/20200219_140512.png" style="border-style:solid; border-width:1px; height:608px; width:403px"/>

The application is ready to be launched on the emulator or target device. This is the base version of the application.

<img src="/TizenSchool/assets/images/tutorials/81/final_start.png" style="border-style:solid; border-width:1px; height:600px; width:338px"/>

# II. Example application

## 1. Goal

1. In this chapter of tutorial we will focus on creating different types of bindings. They will let us rotate label and show angles of those rotations. Also we will create button that resets each value.

<img src="/TizenSchool/assets/images/tutorials/81/1.png" style="border-style:solid; border-width:1px; height:600px; width:776px"/>

## 2. View-to-view binding

To make view-to-view binding firstly we must define source and target. In our case we want to take values from sliders and rotate label by those values. Then a target is _Rotation_ property of label and a source is value of slider. We have three axes, so there are three sliders. As you can see each slider has defined x:Name, what is needed to create view-to-view binding.

Add following propreties to our label.

<highlight>12-14</highlight>

```xml
<ContentPage.Content>
    <Grid>
        <Grid.RowDefinitions>
            <RowDefinition Height="*" />
            <RowDefinition Height="Auto" />
            <RowDefinition Height="250" />
            <RowDefinition Height="Auto" />
        </Grid.RowDefinitions>

        <Label Text="Hello Tizen!"
                Grid.Row="0"
                RotationX="{Binding Source={x:Reference Name='XSlider'}, Path=Value}"
                RotationY="{Binding Source={x:Reference Name='YSlider'}, Path=Value}"
                Rotation="{Binding Source={x:Reference Name='ZSlider'}, Path=Value}"
                HorizontalOptions="Center"
                VerticalOptions="Center" />

        <StackLayout Grid.Row="1"

```

This notation says that value for rotation will be taken from other property by binding mechanism. Our source is slider object and its _Value_ property.

After this modification we could run our application and test it. Label should rotate now.

<img src="/TizenSchool/assets/images/tutorials/81/without_values_rotated.png" style="border-style:solid; border-width:1px; height:600px; width:338px"/>

## 3. Creating context class for page

In order to create different types of binding we must create data context for our view. So add new class named **_ViewModel_ .cs** :

<img src="/TizenSchool/assets/images/tutorials/81/20200219_134235.png" style="border-style:solid; border-width:1px; height:500px; width:720px"/>

As I mentioned in introducion this class must implement _INotifyPropertyChanged_ interface from _System.ComponentModel_ namespace.

```csharp
using System.ComponentModel;
using System.Runtime.CompilerServices;

namespace BindingTutorial
{
    class ViewModel : INotifyPropertyChanged
    {
        public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged;

        protected virtual void OnPropertyChanged([CallerMemberName] string propertyName = null)
        {
            PropertyChanged?.Invoke(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(propertyName));
        }
    }
}
```

Now if we want to update view, we have to call method  _OnPropertyChanged._

## 4. One-way binding

In this section we will fill labels that display numeric values of rotation angles.

Firstly we need to set Binding the ViewModel. In **_MainPage.xaml_** add following lines:

<highlight>6-8</highlight>

```xml
<ContentPage xmlns="http://xamarin.com/schemas/2014/forms"
             xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml"
             x:Class="BindingTutorial.MainPage"
             xmlns:main="clr-namespace:BindingTutorial;assembly=BindingTutorial"
             BackgroundColor="White">
    <ContentPage.BindingContext>
        <main:ViewModel />
    </ContentPage.BindingContext>

    <ContentPage.Content>
        <Grid>

```

Now we have created **new**  instance of _Context_ class and set it as binding context.

Hence, we are ready to add properties that will be our sources. Open **_ViewModel.cs_** file and add three integer properties:

But as I mentioned before we need to invoke PropertyChanged event when property is changed. So let's do this:

<highlight>5-37</highlight>

```csharp
namespace BindingTutorial
{
    class ViewModel : INotifyPropertyChanged
    {
        private int _x;
        private int _y;
        private int _z;

        public int X
        {
            get => _x;
            set
            {
                _x = value;
                OnPropertyChanged();
            }
        }

        public int Y
        {
            get => _y;
            set
            {
                _y = value;
                OnPropertyChanged();
            }
        }

        public int Z
        {
            get => _z;
            set
            {
                _z = value;
                OnPropertyChanged();
            }
        }

```

As you can see, we had to add private fields that hold actual values of properties.

Now, when we have source properties, we are ready to create actual binding. Go back to **_MainPage.xaml_** and change _Text_ property of each label as follows:

<highlight>4-9</highlight>

```xml
<StackLayout Grid.Row="1"
                Orientation="Horizontal"
                HorizontalOptions="Center">
    <Label Text="{Binding X, StringFormat='X: {0}'}"
            Margin="50, 0, 50, 0" />
    <Label Text="{Binding Y, StringFormat='Y: {0}'}"
            Margin="50, 0, 50, 0" />
    <Label Text="{Binding Z, StringFormat='Z: {0}'}"
            Margin="50, 0, 50, 0" />
</StackLayout>

```

We are almost done. We set up binding for displaying angle of rotation, but we don't update it in any way. We need to create another binding with our X, Y, Z properties and values of rotations from sliders. Just change _Value_ properties of sliders:

<highlight>4,9,14</highlight>

```xml
<Slider x:Name="XSlider"
        Minimum="0"
        Maximum="360"
        Value="{Binding X, Mode=OneWayToSource}"
        Margin="50, 0, 50, 0" />
<Slider x:Name="YSlider"
        Minimum="0"
        Maximum="360"
        Value="{Binding Y, Mode=OneWayToSource}"
        Margin="50, 0, 50, 0" />
<Slider x:Name="ZSlider"
        Minimum="0"
        Maximum="360"
        Value="{Binding Z, Mode=OneWayToSource}"
        Margin="50, 0, 50, 0" />
</StackLayout>

```

Please note that we had to change _Mode_ of binding to _OneWayToSource_ , because we want to update **Source** not Target.

Now labels should display angles of rotations.

<img src="/TizenSchool/assets/images/tutorials/81/final_rotated.png" style="border-style:solid; border-width:1px; height:600px; width:338px"/>

## 5. Two-way binding

In this final section we will create action for _Reset_ button.

Firstly we need to create method that will be executed on button click. Open **_ViewModel.cs_** file and add new method:

<highlight>6-9</highlight>

```csharp
        _z = value;
        OnPropertyChanged();
    }
}

private void ResetValues()
{
    X = Y = Z = 0;
}

```

Now we need property of type Command from Xamarin.Forms namespace. Command is a special type that helps with data binding and events. Some classes supports using commands instead of events. That allows us to move UI logic to context classes rather than handling them in code behind.

Commanding is supported by following Xamarin.Forms classes:

Hence, we need to create Command property in our **_ViewModel_** class and create instance in class constructor. In parameter we pass our new method.

<highlight>1,8-12</highlight>

```csharp
public Command ResetCommand { get; set; }

private void ResetValues()
{
    X = Y = Z = 0;
}

public ViewModel()
{
    ResetCommand = new Command(ResetValues);
}

```

Now in **_MainPage.xaml_** we could add logic to button.

<highlight>2</highlight>

```csharp
 <Button Text="Reset"
         Command="{Binding ResetCommand}"
         Grid.Row="3"
         Margin="50, 10, 50, 10" />

```

Unfortunately this is not enough. Now we want to change sliders values from UI and from code. We need to change binding mode to TwoWay:

<highlight>4,9,14</highlight>

```csharp
<Slider x:Name="XSlider"
        Minimum="0"
        Maximum="360"
        Value="{Binding X, Mode=TwoWay}"
        Margin="50, 0, 50, 0" />
<Slider x:Name="YSlider"
        Minimum="0"
        Maximum="360"
        Value="{Binding Y, Mode=TwoWay}"
        Margin="50, 0, 50, 0" />
<Slider x:Name="ZSlider"
        Minimum="0"
        Maximum="360"
        Value="{Binding Z, Mode=TwoWay}"
        Margin="50, 0, 50, 0" />

```

Ok, now button should set rotations to 0.

## 6. Testing

Congratulations! Our application is finished.

Change sliders value and observe that every element of UI is changing. Data binding helps keep the code clean and separate UI and buisness logic.
