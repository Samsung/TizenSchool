# Ⅰ. Introduction

## 1. Gear Maze?

You must escape from the maze with invisible walls.

After you enter the maze from the bottom left corner, you have to exit on the upper right corner.



There are invisible walls insider the maze. Try to memorize and avoid these walls.

When you hit a wall, you have to go back to the starting point and the other player takes his/her turn



This is a map before you activate it. In this status, your steps won't count and can not move.

Tap the map before you move.

There are items and traps hidden in the maze. Some of them protects you and some of them do the opposite.

The Gear will help you go through the mazes.

## 3. Game Rules

<img src="/assets/images/tutorials/69/sticker_rgb-01.png" style="height:350px; width:350px"/>

**GearMaze** is a maze game you can enjoy while walking wearing a Samsung Gear in real world.

Escape the maze through invisible walls using various items and achieving diverse missions.

You can even enjoy it with your friends! You can download it from Samsung Galaxy Apps.

## 4. Technical Information

<img src="/assets/images/tutorials/69/20170922_085528.png" style="height:388px; width:1137px"/>



You are locked up in a cube.

The cube consists of 5 floors and each floor has 9 rooms.

<img src="/assets/images/tutorials/69/20170922_085705.png" style="height:509px; width:694px"/>



A room is a maze. Go through the rooms in order and find a core in the last room.

<img src="/assets/images/tutorials/69/20170922_085246.png" style="height:333px; width:509px"/>



The core will unlock the next floor. Find all 5 cores to escape the cube.

# Ⅱ. Used Technique

## 1. Step Recognition (Gait Recognition)

The most important thing of this game is step recognition.

We use **DeviceMotion event among the W3C APIs** for step recognition.



The direction is measured based on the acceleration on the x, y, and z sides when the user moves in a specific direction.

## 2. Spider Item using Accelerometer Sensor

<img src="/assets/images/tutorials/69/20170924_145933.png" style="height:338px; width:330px"/>



■ Misson

You must shake your arm as fast as possible to get rid of the spiders





■ How to implement

SPIDER item is using the Accelerometer sensor to detect whether each spider is on or off.

This item uses DeviceMotionEvent(W3C API) because the changes of acceleration are used.



For more information, please visit the [Implement SPIDER using accelerator sensor](/tutorial/68).

## 3. Black Hole Item using Barometer Sensor

Gear Maze offers the "Gear Maze Watcher" Android application for Game Watcher.

<img src="/assets/images/tutorials/69/20170922_093539.png" style="height:485px; width:753px"/>

For the "Gear Maze Watcher", we used the Companion type application.

Companion type applications mean an application model which needs data communication or interaction between an Android mobile application and a Gear application. The communication protocol between the Gear and mobile applications is called SAP (Samsung Accessory Protocol).

## 4. EMP Item using HeartRateMonitor Sensor

<img src="/assets/images/tutorials/69/20170924_145915.png" style="height:339px; width:326px"/>



■ Misson

You must sit and jump as high as possible to escape from the blackhole





■ How to implement

Black Hole item is using the Barometer sensor to detect the air pressure.

We can see the change in height from the change in air pressure.



For more information, please visit the [Implement BLACKHOLE using barometer sensor](/tutorial/83).

## 5. Communication between Gear and Phone

<img src="/assets/images/tutorials/69/20170924_145856.png" style="height:333px; width:323px"/>



■ Misson

- You can fire EMP to remove adjacent walls if you raise heartbeat by 10bpm





■ How to implement

EMP item is using the Heart Rate Monitor sensor to detect the heart rate.
