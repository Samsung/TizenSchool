# Introduction

## Overview

In this tutorial based on Notification Monitor application sample code you will learn how to use Bluetooth with [Bluetooth.Network](https://docs.tizen.org/application/dotnet/api/tizenfx/api/Tizen.Network.Bluetooth.html) library.

You will learn how to use the Bluetooth adapter to pair, connect and receive data from other devices.

The newly-created app will monitor and display notifications received via Bluetooth from an Android device.

The example application for Android mobile will be available to download at the end of this tutorial.

This tutorial consists of 3 chapters:

The final effect is presented below.

The content of this tutorial is under the _..._  license.

## Importing and building solution

Download source code from the _[link](https://tizenschool.org/assets/images/tutorials/223/NotificationsMonitor.zip)._

If you need help with loading and building downloaded solution, please follow the tutorial ["How to import project to Visual Studio"](https://tizenschool.org/tutorial/110/contents/1). After that, the structure of the project should look similar to the image below:

<img src="/assets/images/tutorials/223/Solution.png" style="height:480px; width:204px"/>

From now on the project is ready to run.

## The first launch of the application

If you don't know how to start working with Tizen IoT and run it on your Raspberry Pi, please follow this tutorial:

[https://tizenschool.org/tutorial/191/contents/1](https://tizenschool.org/tutorial/191/contents/1)

As soon as your Tizen IoT is ready on your Raspberry Pi, you are ready to run the application which you downloaded in the last step. Running application is described in the tutorial linked above.

Started application should look as below.

_<img src="/assets/images/tutorials/223/bluetoothDisconnected.png" style="height:360px; width:640px"/>_

## Starting Bluetooth on Tizen IoT

Starting Bluetooth is required for the future tasks. Bluetooth API does not give possibility to start Bluetooth from code. You have to do it inside system settings.

To enable Bluetooth, please go to System settings and choose Bluetooth. Next click on **"Bluetooth"** switch button.

<img src="/assets/images/tutorials/223/settings_arrow.png" style="height:360px; width:640px"/>

<img src="/assets/images/tutorials/223/bluetooth_arrow.png" style="height:360px; width:640px"/>

From now on the Bluetooth is enabled.

## Bluetooth devices page

First page that appears after application is started is the BluetoothDevicesPage. On this page there will be a status displayedof the Bluetooth adapter.

If the Bluetooth is disabled, then relevant information will be displayed.

If the Bluetooth is enabled, then there will be possibility to run scanning for available Bluetooth devices. Available Bluetooth devices will be displayed on this page also.

## Notifications page

On this page notifications received from the Android phone will be displayed. The page will occur after correct pairing with the Bluetooth device.

Information from notifications which will be displayed are presented below:

## Notification monitor service

This service is responsible for monitoring of coming notifications which were received by the BluetoothService.

After receiving notification service convert it and add it to list which will be displayed by NotificationsPage.

# Implementation

## Overview

In this chapter you will program the login of the Bluetooth adapter support and all mechanisms of it that are required for Bluetooth connection.

Here are the steps which you are going to take in the next pages of this tutorial:

## Adding privileges

Before we dive into developing BluetoothAdapter, support privileges for Bluetooth needs to be added. In order to do this, you have to modify the **tizen-manifest.xml** file.

Please open tizen-manifest.xaml in visual studio and go to **"Privileges"** tab. In this tab click **"Add"** and select privilege of the name "[http://tizen.org/privilege/bluetooth](http://tizen.org/privilege/bluetooth)". After this step and building the project you should have a possibility to use Bluetooth adapter in Tizen IoT.

## Checking bluetooth status

At the beginning you have to check if the Bluetooth adapter is enabled. The communication via Bluetooth would not be possible without this. Enabling Bluetooth adapter from code is not possible, so if you want to use it in your application, you have to be sure that it is enabled.

Please go to the file BluetoothService.cs and change the definition of the IsBluetoothEnabled property to :

<highlight>4</highlight>

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Gets a value indicating whether the bluetooth is enabled or not.
/// </summary>
public bool IsBluetoothEnabled => BluetoothAdapter.IsBluetoothEnabled;


```

[BluetoothAdapter](https://docs.tizen.org/application/dotnet/api/tizenfx/api/Tizen.Network.Bluetooth.BluetoothAdapter.html) class is responsible for controlling Bluetooth adapter and taking list of paired devices.

Now after running the application, you should see the following image:

<img src="/assets/images/tutorials/223/noDevice.png" style="height:360px; width:640px"/>

It happens because **BluetoothDevicesPage** using property **IsBluetoothEnabled** from **BluetoothDevicesViewModel** checks if the Bluetooth is enabled and it sets appropriate view according to this value.

## Searching available Bluetooth devices

After learning that Bluetooth is enabled, you can start to use adapter in your application. For start let's search for devices available to pair. Please go to asynchronous method **StartSearching** from BluetoothService.

Add the following code to this method.

<highlight>8-21</highlight>

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Starts searching for the available to pair bluetooth device.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="cancellationToken">Cancellation token.</param>
/// <param name="searchingPeriod">Amount of searching time.</param>
public async Task StartSearching(CancellationToken cancellationToken, int searchingPeriod = 3000)
{
    try
    {
        BluetoothAdapter.StartDiscovery();
        await Task.Delay(searchingPeriod, cancellationToken).ConfigureAwait(false);
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Tizen.Log.Debug(Config.LogTag, $"{ex}");
    }
    finally
    {
        BluetoothAdapter.StopDiscovery();
        Tizen.Log.Debug(Config.LogTag, "Stop discovery");
    }
}


```

In the code above at the beginning the **StartDiscovery** method from BluetoothAdapter class is executed. Method [StartDiscovery ](https://docs.tizen.org/application/dotnet/api/tizenfx/api/Tizen.Network.Bluetooth.BluetoothAdapter.html#Tizen_Network_Bluetooth_BluetoothAdapter_StartDiscovery)starts scanning for available Bluetooth devices. After that, the method waits for the time defined in the **searchingPeriod** field. Finally, the discovery is stopped. If any device is found, the [DiscoveryStateChanged](https://docs.tizen.org/application/dotnet/api/tizenfx/api/Tizen.Network.Bluetooth.BluetoothAdapter.html#Tizen_Network_Bluetooth_BluetoothAdapter_DiscoveryStateChanged) from class BluetoothAdapter will be invoked.

That is why you have to subscribe this event as it is shown below:

<highlight>3,8</highlight>

```csharp
try
{
    BluetoothAdapter.DiscoveryStateChanged += DiscoveryStateChanged;
    BluetoothAdapter.StartDiscovery();
    ...
finally
{
    BluetoothAdapter.DiscoveryStateChanged -= DiscoveryStateChanged;
	BluetoothAdapter.StopDiscovery();
    ...

```

Now you have to add **DicoveryStateChanged** method which will be raised with this event.

<highlight>1-12</highlight>

```csharp
private void DiscoveryStateChanged(object sender, DiscoveryStateChangedEventArgs e)
{
    if (e.DiscoveryState == BluetoothDeviceDiscoveryState.Found)
    {
        Tizen.Log.Debug(Config.LogTag, "Found device!!");
        if (e.DeviceFound is object && e.DeviceFound.Name is object)
        {
            _devices.Add(e.DeviceFound);
            DeviceFound?.Invoke(this, e.DeviceFound.Name);
        }
    }
}


```

This method adds the device found into the **\_devices** list and then invokes event **DeviceFound** . The method is subscribed by **BluetoothDeviceViewModel** , so the names of the available devices should show on the screen after running the search.

The last step which is more _educational_ than required is removing all currently paired devices from BluetoothAdapter.

At the beginning of the **StartSearching** method add following instruction:

<highlight>3</highlight>

```csharp
public async Task StartSearching(CancellationToken cancellationToken, int searchingPeriod = 3000)
{
    DestroyBonds();

	try
    {
        ...

```

And definition of **DestronBonds** method:

<highlight>1-7</highlight>

```csharp
private void DestroyBonds()
{
    foreach (var device in BluetoothAdapter.GetBondedDevices())
    {
        device.DestroyBond();
    }
}

```

Searching for available devices is ready! Start the application and click the search button. If there is any Bluetooth device available to pair, the screen should look as below:

<img src="/assets/images/tutorials/223/deviceFound.png" style="height:360px; width:640px"/>

## Pairing with Bluetooth device

Now it's time to pair with another Bluetooth device. This will be required for creating connection between Bluetooth devices later. The connection will be established by the Android application.

To pair with Bluetooth device, we have to add some code into the **Pair** method of the BluetoothService. Fill it as follows:

<highlight>7-17</highlight>

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Pairs with the device of the provided name.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="deviceName">The name of the device to pair with.</param>
public void Pair(string deviceName)
{
    try
    {
        _boundedDevice = _devices.First(dev => dev.Name == deviceName);
        _boundedDevice.BondCreated += OnBondCreated;
        _boundedDevice.CreateBond();
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Tizen.Log.Debug(Config.LogTag, $"{ex}");
        throw;
    }
}

```

As you can see, the method searches for the first device of the provided name. Then it subscribes the event BondCreated of this device and runs method [CreateBond](https://docs.tizen.org/application/dotnet/api/tizenfx/api/Tizen.Network.Bluetooth.BluetoothDevice.html#Tizen_Network_Bluetooth_BluetoothDevice_CreateBond). That method pairs our device with the device on which the method was called.

Now, let's add the method **OnBondCreated** which will be invoked by the BondCreated. Add the following definition to BluetoothService:

<highlight>1-7</highlight>

```csharp
private void OnBondCreated(object sender, BondCreatedEventArgs e)
{
    if (e is object)
	{
	    Paired?.Invoke(this, e.Device.Name);
	}
}


```

This method invokes Paired event to inform subscribers that the device has been paired.

Now add bound destroyingwhen  **BluetoothService**  is closing as below

<highlight>6-9</highlight>

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Stops the RFComm server and destroys bound with the device.
/// </summary>
public void Close()
{
    if (_boundedDevice is object && _boundedDevice.IsPaired)
    {
        _boundedDevice.DestroyBond();
    }
}

```

Pairing is ready. Run the application and click Pair on some available device. If pairing is succeeded, then you should see the following message.

<img src="/assets/images/tutorials/223/paired.png" style="height:360px; width:640px"/>

## RFComm server

If you don't know what is RFComm serwer or SPP protocol, please visit this page [https://docs.tizen.org/application/dotnet/guides/connectivity/bluetooth/](https://docs.tizen.org/application/dotnet/guides/connectivity/bluetooth/)

In this tutorial our application will be an RFComm server.

To start with, we have to add UUID for our server. For SPP connection it is common to use _UUID = "00001101-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb"_ and this is exactly what we will set.

Please define following field in BluetoothService class.

<highlight>6</highlight>

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Provides all methods and properties to manage bluetooth connections and data transfer.
/// </summary>
public sealed class BluetoothService
{
    private const string UUID = "00001101-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb";

```

**Remember that if you  change UUID to something else, you have to change it also in the Android app! In the other case connection will not be possible!**

Now go to method **StartRFCommServer** from class BluetoothService and add following code:

<highlight>6-17</highlight>

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Starts the RFComm server.
/// </summary>
public void StartRfcommServer()
{
    try
    {
        _serverSocket = BluetoothAdapter.CreateServerSocket(UUID);
        _serverSocket.Listen();
        _serverSocket.AcceptStateChanged += AcceptStateChanged;
        IsRfcommStarted = true;
        Log.Debug(Config.LogTag, "Server socket started");
    }
    catch (InvalidOperationException ex)
    {
        Log.Debug(Config.LogTag, $@"Bluetooth is not enabled or the socket create\listen error occurs.\n{ex}");
    }
}

```

At the beginning of this method, the instance of the RFComm server is created by the [CreateServerSocet(uuid)](https://docs.tizen.org/application/dotnet/api/tizenfx/api/Tizen.Network.Bluetooth.BluetoothAdapter.html#Tizen_Network_Bluetooth_BluetoothAdapter_CreateServerSocket_System_String_) method.

After correct creation of RFComm server, the method [Listen](https://docs.tizen.org/application/dotnet/api/tizenfx/api/Tizen.Network.Bluetooth.BluetoothServerSocket.html#Tizen_Network_Bluetooth_BluetoothServerSocket_Listen) of this server is called. This method is responsible for listening for any connection coming via RFComm socket. After that we start subscribing AcceptStateChanged of this server. If this event is invoked, some device has established the Bluetooth connection with our device or has been disconnected. Please add definition of the method **AcceptStateChanged** to BluetothService:

<highlight>1-13</highlight>

```csharp
private void AcceptStateChanged(object sender, AcceptStateChangedEventArgs e)
{
    if (e.State == BluetoothSocketState.Connected)
    {
        _client = e.Connection.Client;
        Log.Debug(Config.LogTag, "Connected to client");
    }
    else if (e.State == BluetoothSocketState.Disconnected)
    {
        _serverSocket.Dispose();
        IsRfcommStarted = false;
    }
}


```

When connection has been established, the method assigns connected client to \_client field. When the connection ends (state disconnected), the server is disposed.

Now add disposing server when  **BluetoothService** is closing:

<highlight>7-11</highlight>

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Stops the RFComm server and destroys bound with the device.
/// </summary>
public void Close()
{
   ...

    if (_serverSocket is object)
    {
        _serverSocket.AcceptStateChanged -= AcceptStateChanged;
        _serverSocket.Dispose();
    }
}

```

RFComm server should now start right after the device has been bound correctly. In the next section, you will learn how to receive data from the client.

## Monitoring notifications

Now you will implement receiving data which has been sent via Bluetooth from the client. The client which has been assigned in the last step provides **DataReceived** event. After the event has been invoked, we would like to get the data and print them on the screen. Add subscribing this event when the client is connecting with our server as follows:

<highlight>5</highlight>

```csharp
if (e.State == BluetoothSocketState.Connected)
{
    _client = e.Connection.Client;
    Log.Debug(Config.LogTag, "Connected to client");
    _client.DataReceived += DataReceived;
}

```

Add also unsubscribing on disconnect

<highlight>3-6,11</highlight>

```csharp
if (e.State == BluetoothSocketState.Connected)
{
    if (_client is object)
    {
        _client.DataReceived -= DataReceived;
    }
    ...
}
else if (e.State == BluetoothSocketState.Disconnected)
{
    _client.DataReceived -= DataReceived;
    _serverSocket.Dispose();


```

Now define the **DataReceived** method which will invoke Received event. That event informs subscribers that data from client has been received. It also transmits the received data inside this event.

The definition of this method should look as below.

<highlight>1-9</highlight>

```csharp
private void DataReceived(object sender, SocketDataReceivedEventArgs e)
{
    if (e?.Data is object)
    {
        Log.Debug(Config.LogTag, "Received");

        Received?.Invoke(this, e.Data.ByteData);
    }
}

```

NotificationMonitorService subscribe Receive event after calling its **Start** method and stops after calling **Stop** method.

NotificationMonitor is ready and now you can test it.

## Testing the NotificationMonitor

Please install Android Application from project which you can download from the following link.

**Remember to give the application the access to the notifications!**

After running the application, it should look as below:

<img src="/assets/images/tutorials/223/screenshot.png" style="height:640px; width:332px"/>

Follow this steps:

From now on the notifications from Android device should appear in the Tizen application!

For the mobile notifications from above image the IoT app should look as below:

<img src="/assets/images/tutorials/223/notifications.png" style="height:360px; width:640px"/>
