## AWS SDK for JavaScript

What Is the AWS SDK for JavaScript?

The AWS SDK for JavaScript provides a JavaScript API for AWS services you can use to build applications for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) or the browser. The JavaScript API lets developers build libraries or applications that make use of AWS services.

Not all services are immediately available in the SDK. To find out which services are currently supported by the AWS SDK for JavaScript, see [https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/blob/master/SERVICES.md](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/blob/master/SERVICES.md)

Using the SDK with Node.js

Using the SDK with Web Browsers (For a list of browsers supported by the AWS SDK for JavaScript, see [Web Browsers Supported](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/browsers-supported.html).)

(...)

Using Amazon Cognito Identity to enable authenticated user access to your browser applications and websites, including use of third-party authentication from Facebook and others.

To prevent users from overwriting or changing other users' objects, users are authenticated using Facebook Login. Each user who logs in has a unique identity that becomes part of the Amazon S3 key assigned to uploaded objects. To protect objects uploaded by other users, use an IAM role assigned user-specific write permissions at the prefix level with an IAM role policy. For more information on IAM roles, see [Creating a Role to Delegate Permissions to an AWS Service](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-service.html) in the IAM User Guide.

When you create an AWS account, your account is provided with root credentials. Those credentials consist of two access keys:


For more information on your access keys, see [Understanding and Getting Your Security Credentials](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html) in the  *AWS General Reference* .

Excercise 1 : run sample app to create bucket and upload a file into S3 using aws-sdk.

Result : Success!

[Notice] this sample code should be tested in AWS (dev) because it failed on Chris server. (I think that this problem is related to the coporate proxy.)

Installing the SDK for JavaScript

Whether and how you install the AWS SDK for JavaScript depends whether the code executes in Node.js modules or browser scripts.

Not all services are immediately available in the SDK. To find out which services are currently supported by the AWS SDK for JavaScript, see [https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/blob/master/SERVICES.md](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/blob/master/SERVICES.md)

ref : [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/installing-jssdk.html](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/installing-jssdk.html)

 

Loading the SDK for JavaScript

How you load the SDK for JavaScript depends on whether you are loading it to run in a web browser or in Node.js.

Not all services are immediately available in the SDK. To find out which services are currently supported by the AWS SDK for JavaScript, see [https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/blob/master/SERVICES.md](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/blob/master/SERVICES.md)

Node.jsReact NativeBrowser

After you install the SDK, you can load the AWS package in your node application using 
`require`
.

```js
var AWS = require('aws-sdk');
```

 

Configuring the SDK for JavaScript

Before you use the SDK for JavaScript to invoke web services using the API, you must configure the SDK. At a minimum, you must configure these settings:


In addition to these settings, you may also have to configure permissions for your AWS resources. For example, you can limit access to an Amazon S3 bucket or restrict an Amazon DynamoDB table for read-only access.

ref : [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/configuring-the-jssdk.html](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/configuring-the-jssdk.html)

 

Region Information

For example : US East (Ohio) => us-east-2

ref : [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html)

 

Setting Credentials

AWS uses credentials to identify who is calling services and whether access to the requested resources is allowed. In AWS, these credentials are typically the access key ID and the secret access key that were created along with your account.

Properly setting credentials ensures that your application or browser script can access the services and resources needed while minimizing exposure to security issues that may impact mission critical applications or compromise sensitive data.

Warning

While it is possible to do so, we recommend you not hard code credentials inside an application or browser script. Hard coding credentials poses a risk of exposing your access key ID and secret access key. ([http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-access-keys-best-practices.html](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-access-keys-best-practices.html))

 

ref : [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/setting-credentials.html](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/setting-credentials.html)

 

Loading Credentials in Node.js from the Shared Credentials File

You can keep your AWS credentials data in a shared file used by SDKs and the command line interface. The SDK for JavaScript automatically searches the shared credentials file for credentials when loading. Where you keep the shared credentials file depends on your operating system:


If you do not already have a shared credentials file, you can create one in the designated directory. Add the following text to the credentials file, replacing  *`<YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID>`*  and  *`<YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>`*  values:

ref : [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/loading-node-credentials-shared.html](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/loading-node-credentials-shared.html)

 

We recommend locking the API version for a service if you rely on it in production code. This can isolate your applications from service changes resulting from updates to the SDK. If you don't specify an API version when creating service objects, the SDK uses the latest API version by default. This could cause your application to reference an updated API with changes that negatively impact your application.

To lock the API version that you use for a service, pass the 
`apiVersion`
 parameter when constructing the service object. In the following example, a newly created 
`AWS.DynamoDB`
service object is locked to the 
`2011-12-05`
 API version:


`var dynamodb = new AWS.DynamoDB({apiVersion: '2011-12-05'});`


ref : [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/locking-api-versions.html](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/locking-api-versions.html)

 

Node.js Considerations

Although Node.js code is JavaScript, using the AWS SDK for JavaScript in Node.js can differ from using the SDK in browser scripts. Some API methods work in Node.js but not in browser scripts, as well as the other way around. And successfully using some APIs depends on your familiarity with common Node.js coding patterns, such as importing and using other Node.js modules like the 
`File System (fs)`
 module.

 

Object Key and Metadata

 **Topics** 


Each Amazon S3 object has data, a key, and metadata. Object key (or key name) uniquely identifies the object in a bucket. Object metadata is a set of name-value pairs. You can set object metadata at the time you upload it. After you upload the object, you cannot modify object metadata. The only way to modify object metadata is to make a copy of the object and set the metadata.

(...)

Safe Characters

The following character sets are generally safe for use in key names:


The following are examples of valid object key names:


Note that the Amazon S3 data model is a flat structure: you create a bucket, and the bucket stores objects. There is no hierarchy of subbuckets or subfolders; however, you can infer logical hierarchy using key name prefixes and delimiters as the Amazon S3 console does. The Amazon S3 console supports a concept of folders. Suppose your bucket (
`admin-created`
) has four objects with the following object keys:


`Development/Projects1.xls`



`Finance/statement1.pdf`



`Private/taxdocument.pdf`



`s3-dg.pdf`

AWS Policy Generator

The AWS Policy Generator is a tool that enables you to create policies that control access to?[Amazon Web Services?(AWS)](http://aws.amazon.com/)?products and resources. For more information about creating policies, see?[key concepts in Using AWS Identity and Access Management](http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/AccessPolicyLanguage_KeyConcepts.html). Here are?[sample policies](http://aws.amazon.com/code/AWS-Policy-Examples).
