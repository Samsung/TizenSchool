## Prerequisites

HW Component

Software OSs, apps and tools

This part is about an application for controller. Application is going to acquire speed and direction from arm position.

## Importing and building app

You can import source-code of controller to Tizen Studio doing following steps:

After that, you can build the app with clicking with right button on project and selecting “Run As” and “Tizen Native Application”.

**Ensure that your device is selected in combo box (its name is going to be different from TW1)**

If you are fine with default settings or don’t want to investigate the code, follow the next part of tutorial [here](https://craftroom.tizen.org/racing-cloud).

What is important is that you can change your way of steering. There are three pre-built configurations of steering:

## Controller’s UI

**Views**

View are written with EFL and they’re quite simple and self-exlpanatory. If you want to add a new view, simply add it to enum and factory, write new header and source file for it.

```c
// view_factory.h
typedef enum _e_view_id {
	VIEW_CONNECT_TO_CAR,
	VIEW_CAR_SELECTION,
	VIEW_CONNECTION_SUCCESSED,
	VIEW_NAME_INPUT,
	VIEW_HELP,
	VIEW_RACING,
	VIEW_RESET,
	VIEW_NETWORK_FAILURE,
  	VIEW_NEW_VIEW, // Add new view in enum
} view_id;
```

```c
// view_factory.c
switch (id) {
		case VIEW_CONNECT_TO_CAR:
			view = view_connect_to_car_init(parent);
			break;
		.
 		.
 		.
		case VIEW_NETWORK_FAILURE:
			view = view_network_failure_init(parent);
			break;
  		case VIEW_NEW_VIEW: //Add new case in factory
    		view = view_new_view(parent);
    		break;
		default:
			break;
```

If you need more detailed explanation for UI functionality or don’t know EFL, you can check it [here](https://www.enlightenment.org/docs/start).

## Managing data from sensors

To deduce demanded speed and direction, we use three sensors:

You can find out more about them [here](https://developer.tizen.org/development/guides/native-application/location-and-sensors/device-sensors).

## Config file

Config files can be found in /home/owner/apps_rw/org.tizen.gear-racing-controller/shared/trusted/

## Communication between car and controller

Protocol of communication between controller is based on messages:

Only COMMAND and CONFIG_USER_NAME carries the information that should be externally processed - the rest serve making and establishing the connection.

If you’d like to add new functionality to your car, you have two ways for that:

In connection managers there are some defines, that can be changed.

```c
//gear-racing-controller
//car_connection_manager.c
#define KEEP_ALIVE_ATTEMPTS 5
#define HELLO_START_ATTEMPTS 5
#define KEEP_ALIVE_INTERVAL 1000 //In ms
#define HELLO_INTERVAL 1000 //In ms

```

```c
//controller_connection_manager.c
#define KEEP_ALIVE_CHECK_ATTEMPTS 5
#define HELLO_ACCEPT_ATTEMPTS 5
#define HELLO_ACCEPT_INTERVAL 1000 //In ms
#define KEEP_ALIVE_CHECK_INTERVAL 1000 //In ms
```

You can change them to change bevaiour of communication. Suppose you want to send KEEP_ALIVE message 8 times per second, and disconnect after third failed check. Additionally, you want to shorten waiting time for CONNECT message to 500ms and send it only two times. Your defines gonna look like the following.

```c
//gear-racing-controller
#define KEEP_ALIVE_ATTEMPTS 2
#define HELLO_START_ATTEMPTS 3
#define KEEP_ALIVE_INTERVAL 125 //In ms
#define HELLO_INTERVAL 500 //In ms
```

```c
//gear-racing-car
#define KEEP_ALIVE_CHECK_ATTEMPTS 2
#define HELLO_ACCEPT_ATTEMPTS 3
#define HELLO_ACCEPT_INTERVAL 500 //In ms
#define KEEP_ALIVE_CHECK_INTERVAL 125 //In ms
```

However, be careful, because due to network latency, too low values will make you unable to establish or keep connection.
