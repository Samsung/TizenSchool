## Prerequisites



HW Component



Software OSs, apps and tools



## Cloud API



**Tip: You can obtain IP address of car through sshing to car and executing ifconfig.**



Communication between cars and controllers can be implemented using simple HTTP request for obtaining information about car.

## Running a cloud



**To get better knowledge about [ASP.NET](http://asp.net/) Core, check out [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app-xplat/start-mvc?view=aspnetcore-2.1) tutorial.**



If you are going just to run the cloud, do following steps:

If everything was configured properly, this view should appear (or in browser in address bar enter the path you have entered as applicationUrl like [http://192.168.1.12:63687](http://192.168.1.12:63687/) or, if you set up it as 0.0.0.0:63687, 127.0.0.1:63687):

**Note: The same URL should be set in car’s config to enable him connection with cloud.**



## Testing



To test if cars are registering and laps are correctly noted, you can go to test page (add /test to address, for example [http://192.168.1.12:63687/test](http://192.168.1.12:63687/test)).

You can check if your car is connected to cloud in “Full Car View”. All registered cars are displayed there (it stays registered only for 15 seconds if it disconnects).

In columns there are informations about car’s:





**They can help you in finding out which car are registered and which are not.**



If you do not need more information about cloud, you can follow to the [next step of tutorial](http://tizenschool.org/tutorial/141/contents/1).

## Cloud changing



Of course you can edit any part of code to adjust it to your needs, apart from:





In /test there are other views that you can use to:
