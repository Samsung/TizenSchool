## Java Development Kit

You must install a Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher to use Emulator Manager & Certificate Manager which were introduced at Preview 2. Do not install OpenJDK.

Download the JDK from the official Oracle Web site. Select the appropriate platform for your hardware architecture and Windows® version. Then, run the downloaded execution file and follow the displayed instructions.

## Visual Studio Tools for Tizen Preview

At first, download the InstallShield wizard

[https://developer.tizen.org/development/tizen-.net-preview/introduction](https://developer.tizen.org/development/tizen-.net-preview/introduction)

The InstallShield wizard sets the basic environment for the Visual Studio extension installer and Tizen Emulator installer. The Tizen C# development environment is organized step by step with a few clicks.

Since the license contains important legal notifications for using Visual Studio Tools for Tizen, read it line by line, and check the I accept the terms in the license agreement check box only when you agree with the license statement.

<img src="/assets/images/tutorials/70/cs_install02.png" style="height:381px; width:500px"/>

After the Install Shield process, the VSIX installer for Tizen MI-based Debugger and Visual Studio Tools for Tizen are launched. These installers add the Tizen application development extensions to Visual Studio.

## Installation Checks

To check that the installation has been successful:

Run Visual Studio 2017.

Go to Tools > Extensions and Update. If you find the Visual Studio Tools for Tizen and Tizen MI-based Debugger items installed, everything is OK.

# Creating .NET Application

## Creating a Project

To build a Tizen .NET application, you must follow these general steps:

You can perform all of these steps in the IDE. The Tizen .NET preview works in Microsoft's Visual Studio 2017. After making sure the [development environment is properly set up](https://developer.tizen.org/development/tizen-.net-preview/visual-studio-tools-tizen), you can create a new Tizen .NET project:

<img src="/assets/images/tutorials/70/cs_first02_1-700x486.png" style="height:486px; width:700px"/>

Once you are happy with the name and location, click  **OK** .

<img src="/assets/images/tutorials/70/cs_first_creating_project_wizard_p3 (1).png" style="height:302px; width:702px"/>

Tizen Project Wizard window is shown as next step. You can define the package name and define which profiles are added in your solution. Click  **OK** .  If you select  **Common**  profile, Mobile and TV profile cannot be selected.

A solution with 2 or 3 projects is created:

If you are already familiar with Xamarin.Forms, this project has exactly the same structure as a Xamarin.Forms portable application, with the "Portable" project being the portable class library and the others being the platform-specific projects; however, for the Tizen .NET preview, only the Tizen platform-specific project is generated.

<img src="/assets/images/tutorials/70/cs_first_creating_solution_explorer.png" style="height:546px; width:346px"/>

The 
`.cs`
 file in the portable project already contains simple Xamarin.Forms code, which makes a basic UI. Therefore, you can now build and run your application.

When you are done running your first application, you can [enhance it further](https://developer.tizen.org/development/tizen-.net-preview/getting-started/creating-your-first-tizen-.net-application#enhancing) by reading a brief overview of what the code generated by the template is doing, and learning about a few more concepts to add to your application appeal.

## Adding a Class Library and Restoring NuGet Manually

To add a class library and restore NuGet manually:

The following figure shows warning messages that you can see in the  **Error List**  window when building the project. These can occur because the application is based on the Microsoft.NETCore.App and the Class library is based on NETStandard.Library, and the difference makes Visual Studio 2017 show a warning. However, it is OK to run the project, because the Microsoft.NETCore.App includes the NETStandard.Library set.

## Adding a Tizen Project to an Existing Xamarin Cross Platform Project

The Xamarin cross platform template consist of a shared PCL (Portable Class Library) and multiple platform dependent application projects for IOS and Android.

To add a new Tizen project:

**Note:** Since the Tizen projects have dependencies with the Xamarin.Forms NuGet package version, you need to install the Xamarin.Forms NuGet package that has the same version as Xamarin.Forms.Platform.Tizen. Mismatching NuGet versions can cause build or packaging problems. To install the proper Xamarin.Forms NuGet package, right-click the solution item in the  **Solution Explorer**  view and select  **Manage NuGet Packages for Solution** .

# Building and Running .NET Application

## Registering an Author Certificate

**If you already have registered a certificate in Visual Studio or can use a default Tizen certificate, you can skip this step.**

After installing the Visual Studio plugin, and before making Tizen package, it is useful to set up a signing certificate.

You have 3 options:

## Building the Solution

To build the solution, go to  **Build > Build Solution**  in the main Visual Studio menu (you can also right-click the solution title in the  **Solution Explorer**  window and select  **Build** ). If the build process works all the way through to the end, the final part of the build output window shows something similar to the following figure - indicating that a 
`.tpk`
 package was built.

**Figure: Building process output**

<img src="/assets/images/tutorials/70/cs_first_building_process-850x161.png" style="height:161px; width:850px"/>
](https://developer.tizen.org/sites/default/files/images/cs_first_building_process.png)

Tizen .NET applications are always deployed as installed packages. The package files take the 
`.tpk`
 suffix, and the package generation is controlled by the manifest file. The Visual Studio template generates a package manifest, which is named 
`tizen-manifest.xml`
 and placed at the top level of the .Tizen project. The default manifest is sufficient to build these example applications without modification. If you need to make any changes, such as changing the icon displayed when the application is installed (it defaults to the Tizen logo), or installing resources that are used by the application at runtime, see [Packaging Your Tizen .NET Application](https://developer.tizen.org/development/tizen-.net-preview/getting-started/creating-your-first-tizen-.net-application#packaging).

## Deploying the Application

To run the application, you must first deploy it to the target: either a device or an emulator. Deploying means transfering the 
`.tpk`
 (package file) to the target and invoking the Tizen package manager to install it; this usually happens in a single command.

To deploy to a target:

Communication with the device happens through the SDB program (Smart Development Bridge). Visual Studio uses this program behind the scenes, so you normally do not have to use it directly, but in case there are problems, you can run the SDB manually to check that it actually finds the device.<br/>To check the SDB, click  **Menu > Tools > Tizen > Tizen Sdb Command Prompt** , and type sdb devices.

The following figure shows an example of a successful emulator detection.

**Figure: Emulator detection**

](https://developer.tizen.org/sites/default/files/images/cs_first08.png)

If you want to change the target to be deployed, you can change it in the Visual Studio configuration manager as shown in the following figure. After selecting the right target in the combo box, go to debugging or start without debugging.

**Figure: Emulator list**

## Running the Application

After the deployment, you can launch the application. If the deployment was successful, the application icon is visible on the device screen. Click the icon to launch the application. The following figure shows the launched application (as seen on the emulator).

**Figure: Application running on the mobile emulator**

**Figure: Application running on the TV emulator**

<img src="/assets/images/tutorials/70/cs_first_building_emulator_tv1.png" style="height:440px; width:844px"/>

If the deployment had problems, try to use the SDB to install the application:

```bash
$ sdb install <path-to-package>/XamarinApplication1.TizenMobile.tpk
```

or

```bash
$ sdb install <path-to-package>/XamarinApplication1.TizenTV.tpk
```

If the installation succeeds, the application icon shows up on the emulator or device screen, and you can click it to launch the application.
