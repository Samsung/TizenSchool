# Introduction

## Overview

In this tutorial, we will learn how to create a custom control in Xamarin.Forms, using examples of list pages in the HearbeatAlarm application.

The tutorial contains 3 chapters:

To have a good usage of this tutorial u should be familiar with basics of C# and Xamarin.Forms.

## Goal

The main goal of this tutorial is to present the way how to create a reusable custom component that fits the solution. Custom controls allow you to gain control over the content and behavior of components.

In this particular case, a list pages will be created. They will use the same list logic but will have different row representations. The final result is shown below.

## Setting up the enviroment

To build and run the Tizen applications and make use of this tutorial, the following environment is required

If you don’t have an environment set up yet, it’s recommended to pass through the “Getting Started with Creating a .NET App” tutorial.

## Starting point

This tutorial is based on the HeartbeatAlarm application, which full version is available HERE. To let us focus on this tutorial’s subject, we will start with a solution that lacks views, which we are going to create using custom controls. So let’s get started.



Step 1: Download and unpack base code.



Step 2: Open directory containing the solution and open HeartbeatAlarm.sln file

To make testing easy, using the emulator is recommended. It lets setting the sensors responses manually.

The User Interface Application we will develop in this tutorial is dependent on the Service Application. It must be launched while running the UI application. To do so, please follow the next steps.



Step 6: Right click on the Solution Explorer view on the solution and select “Restore NuGet Packages” form the context menu to set up all packages and wait for it.
