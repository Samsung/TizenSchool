## Prerequisites

**HW Component**

**Software OSs, apps and tools**

## Source code

[Source code of car application](https://review.tizen.org/gerrit/#/q/project:apps/native/gear-racing-car)

## Assembling a car

Just follow the instruction, that you can find [here](https://www.sunfounder.com/rpi-car.html). If your kit is different than in the link, build it according to its manual.

<img src="/TizenSchool/assets/images/tutorials/134/20181116_165223.jpg" style="height:768px; width:1024px"/>

Additionaly, you may connect one more component - reed switch. It is used to counter laps made by car. It is going to allow you laptime counting.

Place it under car (you can do it like this):

<img src="/TizenSchool/assets/images/tutorials/134/ReedSwitch.jpg" style="height:768px; width:1024px"/>

And connect it to the board:

<img src="/TizenSchool/assets/images/tutorials/134/Car.jpg" style="height:1022px; width:1024px"/>

After connecting all of the components, you can flash Micro SD card with image avalible [here](https://samsung.github.io/TizenSchool/tutorial/134/contents/2). It has preinstalled our version of car application, however, in next parts there are instructions how to prepare your own version of this aplication.

## Configuration of a car

You need one more thing to configure your car - networking. To get into your car’s system, we going to use SSH (Secure shell). Connect your computer and Raspberry with cable.

If you are working on Linux and you are using USB Ethernet Adapter, use this script to establish connection between your computer and Raspberry:

```bash
PC_INTERFACE="eno1"
USB_INTERFACE="unset"
USB_PC_IP="10.0.0.1"
USB_RPI3_IP="10.0.0.2"
NETMASK="255.255.255.0"

readChar()
{
    stty -icanon -echo
    eval "$1=$(dd bs=1 count=1 2>/dev/null)"
    stty icanon echo
}

getUsbInterface()
{
    if [ "$USB_INTERFACE" =  "unset" ]; then
        echo "setting usb interface variable"
        USB_INTERFACE=`ip -o link show | awk -F ': ' '{print $2}' | grep enx`
        INTERFACE_COUNT=`echo "$USB_INTERFACE" | wc -l`
        if [ "$INTERFACE_COUNT" -ne '1' ]; then
            echo "Got $INTERFACE_COUNT interfaces"
            echo "$USB_INTERFACE"
            exit 1
        fi
        echo "Got: $USB_INTERFACE interface. Is it correct?"
        echo "(No case sensitive) Y-yes, N-no, E-exit: "
        readChar REPLY
        #read -n 1 -r
        echo ""
        case "$REPLY" in
            [eE])
                exit 2;;
            [nN])
                exit 3;;
        esac
    fi
}

setupIpForwarding()
{
    if [ -f /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward ]; then
        if [ `cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward` -eq 0 ]; then
            echo "Enabling routing"
            sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
        else
            echo "Routing enabled"
        fi
    else
        echo "file not exist: /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward"
        sudo echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
        retval="$?"
        if [ "$retval" -ne 0 ]; then
            echo "Return code was not zero but $retval"
            echo "Exiting"
            exit 1
        fi
    fi
}

configureUsbInterface()
{
    echo "Configuring $USB_INTERFACE interface:"
    sudo ifconfig $USB_INTERFACE $USB_PC_IP netmask $NETMASK
}

configureFirewall()
{
    echo "Configuring firewall:"
    sudo iptables -A INPUT -i $USB_INTERFACE -j ACCEPT
    sudo iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
    sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o $PC_INTERFACE -j MASQUERADE
    sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i $PC_INTERFACE -o $USB_INTERFACE -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
    sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i $USB_INTERFACE -o $PC_INTERFACE -j ACCEPT
}

getUsbInterface
setupIpForwarding
configureUsbInterface
configureFirewall
```

Save it as rpi3_network.sh, go to catalog with rpi_network.sh file and run:

```bash
chmod +x rpi3_network.sh
./rpi3_network.sh
```

After that, to run a shell of car, use ssh (password is “tizen”):

```bash
ssh root@10.0.0.2
```

**(optional) With Tizen Studio comes device manager - if you know IP address of Raspberry, you can connect it thorugh SDB (Smart Development Bridge). (Default address given in script is 10.0.0.2)**

To do that, you need to add it do device manager:

<img src="/TizenSchool/assets/images/tutorials/134/DeviceManager1Cut-1.png" style="height:718px; width:1000px"/>

<img src="/TizenSchool/assets/images/tutorials/134/DeviceManager2Cut-1.png" style="height:291px; width:403px"/>

<img src="/TizenSchool/assets/images/tutorials/134/DeviceManager3Cut.png" style="height:243px; width:302px"/>

Now you can connect with

```bash
sdb shell
```

If you have more devices with tizen connected, use

```bash
//sdb -s <ip address>:26101 shell
sdb -s 10.0.0.2:26101 shell
```

**When you have an access to Raspberry shell, run**

```bash
wifi_connection_mgr
```

<img src="/TizenSchool/assets/images/tutorials/134/14312125-10-18.jpg" style="height:255px; width:592px"/>

Enter 1 to init WiFi manager.

<img src="/TizenSchool/assets/images/tutorials/134/14315925-10-18.jpg" style="undefined"/>

Enter 1 to go to “Public” section;

<img src="/TizenSchool/assets/images/tutorials/134/14321225-10-18.jpg" style="height:443px; width:589px"/>

Enter 6 to choose network to connect with.

<img src="/TizenSchool/assets/images/tutorials/134/14324925-10-18.jpg" style="height:260px; width:589px"/>

Enter 1.

<img src="/TizenSchool/assets/images/tutorials/134/14330225-10-18.jpg" style="height:225px; width:592px"/>

Enter 1 and after that enter the SSID of your network.

<img src="/TizenSchool/assets/images/tutorials/134/14333925-10-18.jpg" style="undefined"/>

Enter 2 and after that enter the passphrase of your network.

<img src="/TizenSchool/assets/images/tutorials/134/14340325-10-18.jpg" style="height:218px; width:591px"/>

<img src="/TizenSchool/assets/images/tutorials/134/14344625-10-182.jpg" style="height:125px; width:585px"/>

Enter c to establish connection.

<img src="/TizenSchool/assets/images/tutorials/134/14352225-10-18.jpg" style="undefined"/>

After success, enter q to quit wifi_mgr_tool.

You need to do one more thing - add server IP you config.

You can get config.ini file from car’s repository. Change ip address to your server’s (computer which is going to host cloud) address.

```ini
[cloud]
#url=http://<ip address>:63687
url=http://192.168.1.124:63687
```

You can change their name and id as well (both have to be shorter than 32 characters)

```ini
[Car]
Id=58ffcf38-b52c-4302-8847-526b0a548631
Name=Cyjan Car

```

**If you have more than one car, they have to have different Ids.**

Next push it to Raspberry with scp

```bash
scp config.ini root@10.0.0.2:/home/owner/apps_rw/org.tizen.car-app/data/config.ini
```

or sdb

```bash
sdb push config.ini /home/owner/apps_rw/org.tizen.car-app/data/config.ini
```

Congratulations, you configured your car. If you want to proceed, check out [how to build an app for controller](https://samsung.github.io/TizenSchool/tutorial/135). If you want to change default behaviour of car, you may follow this tutorial for additional informations.

## Car application

Due to native support for C for Tizen, we wrote our application in this language. Basic knowledge about it can be helpful in understanding this part of tutorial.

**Steering**

Config file looks like this

```ini
[Car]

```

You can connect your diode to distinguish your cars or to get informations about current state of car.

**Buiding and deploying app**

**Note: If you want to change something in your applications, communication between car and controller is described in the next part of tutorial.**

There are two ways to build an app:

**Building with Tizen Studio**

To build platform project with Tizen Studio, you need IoT-Headless package. To download and install it, you need to:

After that, you can just click your project in Tizen Studio and click “Build Project”.

**Building with GBS (Git Build System)**

If you don’t have GBS installed, you can download it [here](https://source.tizen.org/documentation/reference/git-build-system).

Building app with GBS is quite simple - just navigate to catalog of your cloned project and launch a command:

```bash
gbs build --arch armv7l --profile 4.0-unified_standard
```

Now you can go to ~/GBS-ROOT/local/repos/4.0_unified_standard/armv7l/RPMS

Copy the file org.tizen.car-app-0.0.1-1.armv7l.rpm to car (ie. to dir /tmp)

```bash
scp org.tizen.car-app-0.0.1-1.armv7l.rpm root@10.0.0.2:/tmp
```

Use ssh to connect with car

```bash
ssh root@10.0.0.2
```

When you’re on car, launch these commands:

```bash
cd /tmp
rpm --force -i org.car-app-0.0.1-1.armv7l.rpm
app_laucher -s org.tizen.car-app
```

## Troubleshoting

If you have problem with file system on car (it says it’s read-only), use:

```bash
mount -o remount,rw /
```

**Pay attention to the space between “rw” and “/” !**

If you build often with GBS, you can add

```bash
--noinit
```

flag to make building faster
