# I. Application Package Manager

## Package Manager

In this lesson we'll look at the package manager, its main functions and data types. We will show you how to make changes to the application by adding information about packages installed to the device.



**Basic Functionality of the Package Manager**

The package manager is used to retrieve detailed information of the installed packages on the device. This information includes the package name, label, and path to the icon image, version etc.

To use the methods and properties of the _PackageManager_ class, include the _Tizen.Applications_ namespace in your application:

```csharp
using Tizen.Applications;
```



Also to be able to get the information about packages, add the following privilege to  _tizen-manifest.xml_  file:

```csharp
<privilege>http://tizen.org/privilege/packagemanager.info</privilege>
```



The main features of the  _Tizen.Applications.PackageManager_  class include:



**Retrieving all installed packages**

To retrieve all package information for installed packages:



**Retrieving Specific Package Information**



**Monitoring Package Events**

To detect package-related events, such as installation, uninstallation, and updates:

The following example implements the installation event handler



**Dependency Service**

Package manager APIs are tizen device specific APIs, so to access this we need to use _DependencyService_ provided by .netcore.

_DependencyService_ allows apps to call into platform-specific functionality from shared code. This functionality enables _Xamarin.Forms_ apps to do anything that a native app can do.

_DependencyService_ is a dependency resolver. In practice, an interface is defined and _DependencyService_ finds the correct implementation of that interface from the various platform projects.



_Xamarin.Forms_ apps need four components to use _DependencyService_ :



**Interface**

The interface you design will define how you interact with platform-specific functionality. Ex. To get the package List we can create an interface like below

```csharp
public interface IInterface
{
	List<MyPackageInfo> GetPackageList();
}
```



**Implementation per Platform**

Once a suitable interface has been designed, that interface must be implemented in the project for each platform that you are targeting. For example, the following class implements the IInterface interface on Tizen.

```csharp
class PlatformAPI : IInterface
{
	public List<MyPackageInfo> GetPackageList()
	{
		List<MyPackageInfo> myPackages = new List<MyPackageInfo>();
		IEnumerable<Package> packageList = PackageManager.GetPackages();
		foreach (Package package in packageList)
		{
			MyPackageInfo packageInfo = new MyPackageInfo();
			packageInfo.Name = package.Label;
			packageInfo.Version = package.Version;
			packageInfo.Icon = package.IconPath;

			myPackages.Add(packageInfo);
		}
		return myPackages;
	}
}
```



**Registration**

Each implementation of the interface needs to be registered with  _DependencyService_ . The following code registers the implementation for Tizen:

```csharp
[assembly: Xamarin.Forms.Dependency(typeof(PlatformAPI))]
namespace WearableLesson_23.Tizen.Wearable
{
    class PlatformAPI : IInterface
    {

```





**Call to DependencyService**

Once the project has been set up with a common interface and implementations for needed platform use _DependencyService_ to get the right implementation at runtime:

```csharp
List<MyPackageInfo>packages = DependencyService.Get<IInterface>().GetPackageList();
```



## Using the Package Manager in the Demo

Now we will move on to the practical part by adding the above listed functions to the application and look at the results. Here we will try to create an Application which maintains a list of all the installed packages on the device and displays its information.



Add the following privilege to  _tizen-manifest.xml_  file:

```csharp
<privilege>http://tizen.org/privilege/packagemanager.info</privilege>
```



Add _Tizen.Applications_ namespace in your application:

```csharp
using Tizen.Applications;
```



To store the package info, we will create a separate class and some property like below.

```csharp
public class MyPackageInfo
{
	public string Name { get; set; }
	public string Version { get; set; }
	public string Icon { get; set; }
}
```



To access platform API, create dependency service, as discussed above. Final interface implementation looks like below.

```csharp
[assembly: Xamarin.Forms.Dependency(typeof(PlatformAPI))]
namespace WearableLesson_23.Tizen.Wearable
{
    class PlatformAPI : IInterface
    {
        public List<MyPackageInfo> GetPackageList()
        {

            List<MyPackageInfo> myPackages = new List<MyPackageInfo>();
            IEnumerable<Package> packageList = PackageManager.GetPackages();
            foreach (Package package in packageList)
            {
                MyPackageInfo packageInfo = new MyPackageInfo();
                packageInfo.Name = package.Label;
                packageInfo.Version = package.Version;
                packageInfo.Icon = package.IconPath;

                myPackages.Add(packageInfo);
            }
            return myPackages;
        }
    }
}
```



By calling the interface method, we can get all the needed information.

```csharp
List<MyPackageInfo>packages = DependencyService.Get<IInterface>().GetPackageList();
```



Use the same code and set the data.

```csharp
public App()
{
	CirclePage circlePage = new CirclePage();
	List<MyPackageInfo> packages = DependencyService.Get<IInterface>().GetPackageList();
	for (int i = 0; i < packages.Count; i++)
	{
		CircleToolbarItem item = new CircleToolbarItem
		{
			SubText = packages[i].Name,
			Icon = packages[i].Icon,
			Text = packages[i].Version,
		};

		circlePage.ToolbarItems.Add(item);
	}
	MainPage = circlePage;
}
```



Here is a sample application which retrieves information about all the installed Packages and displays them in a circular fashion. When a particular icon is focused, Package name and version is displayed at center.

# II. Application Manager

## Information about Installed and Running apps

In this lesson we'll look at the application manager, to find out what information about the application we can get by using it. We will make some changes to the application by replacing package manager with an application manager.



The application manager provides information about installed and running applications. It provides functions for obtaining the application name and absolute path to application's public folder, and so on. To use functions and data types of the application manager, include following namespace in the application:

```csharp
using Tizen.Applications;
```



It is necessary to distinguish the application manager from the package manager; the difference is that in application manager several applications can be placed in one package. So, the package is a larger entity. You can create 3 applications: ui-, widget- and service application, and then merge them into one package, which will be downloaded to the application store.



**Getting information about the running application**

If you want to use the functions for getting information about the running applications without using the application manager functions, you have to use _Tizen.Applications_ namespace.

Now, let’s looks at the important functions:



**Getting Information about Installed Applications**

To get information about all the installed applications, call the _GetInstalledApplicationsAsync()_ \**\*\* method of the *ApplicationManager\* class.

```csharp
Task<IEnumerable<ApplicationInfo>> task = ApplicationManager.GetInstalledApplicationsAsync();
IEnumerable<ApplicationInfo> count = await task;


```



Now we can retrieve the _ApplicationType, IconPath, ExecutablePath, ApplicationID_ and much more.

```csharp
foreach (ApplicationInfo appInfo in tt1.Result)
{
		Log.Debug("Tag", "applicationId: " + appInfo.ApplicationId);
		Log.Debug("Tag", "packageId: " + appInfo.PackageId);
		Log.Debug("Tag", "label: " + appInfo.Label);
		Log.Debug("Tag", "executablePath: " + appInfo.ExecutablePath);
		Log.Debug("Tag", "iconPath: " + appInfo.IconPath);
		Log.Debug("Tag", "applicationType: " + appInfo.ApplicationType);
		Log.Debug("Tag", "isNoDisplay: " + appInfo.IsNoDisplay.ToString());
		Log.Debug("Tag", "isOnBoot: " + appInfo.IsOnBoot.ToString());
		Log.Debug("Tag", "isPreload: " + appInfo.IsPreload.ToString());
		Log.Debug("Tag", "sharedResourcePath: " + appInfo.SharedResourcePath);
}
```



**Using the Application Manager in the Demo**

Let’s move on to the practical part by adding the above listed functions to the application and look at the results. Here we will try to create an Application which maintains a list of all the installed application on the device and when any icon is clicked, we will display the details of the selected application.



We need to replace only one function from our previous lesson i.e. instead of _GetPackageList()_ , we will implement _GetApplicationList()_ .

Apart from this code is mostly same.

```csharp
public async Task<List<AppsInfo>> GetApplicationList()
{
	ApplicationInfoFilter appInfoFilter = new ApplicationInfoFilter();
	appInfoFilter.Filter.Add(ApplicationInfoFilter.Keys.NoDisplay, "false");

	List<AppsInfo> myApps = new List<AppsInfo>();
	IEnumerable<ApplicationInfo> task = await ApplicationManager.GetInstalledApplicationsAsync(appInfoFilter);

	foreach (ApplicationInfo info in task)
	{
		AppsInfo appInfo = new AppsInfo();
		appInfo.Name = info.Label;
		appInfo.AppId = info.ApplicationId;
		appInfo.Icon = info.IconPath;
		myApps.Add(appInfo);
	}
	return myApps;
}

```



Here we have also added one filter in the app list to add only those apps which have any graphical user interface.



Here is a sample application which retrieves information about all the installed applications and when the icon is clicked, some of its details will be displayed.

# III. Launching Third Party Applications

## Brief Description of the Module

In this lesson we'll look at the application management module, its main functions and data types, application launch types, and the ability to share application functionality with other applications.

Also in this lesson we will finish 4th demo application, which was started in the [lesson 22](http://tizenschool.org/tutorial/118/contents/1), by adding the ability to run the selected application.



**Brief Description of the Module**



An application control (app control) is a way of sharing an application's functionality with other applications. Using another application's features through application controls reduces the time and effort needed to develop your own application.

For example, if you want to add to the application the option of telephone call to the required number, you can launch the device built-in application for calls. Don’t forget to indicate, which functionality you are interested in. The calling application can also get from the called application the result of the requested functionality execution if it is implemented in it.

An application can be launched by the user from the launcher or by another application through the application control. The application control launch request describes either an action to be performed by other applications, or the results of that action. The application can also receive results from the launched application through an application control reply.



The main application control features are:











## Launch Request

To use the _AppControl_ class, we need to add below namespace

```csharp
using Tizen.Applications;
```



To use the functionality of this module in your application, add the following privilege to the manifest file.

```csharp
"http://tizen.org/privilege/appmanager.launch"
```



We need to create an instance of _AppControl_ before calling any functions.

```csharp
AppControl appcontrol = new AppControl();
```



The following function is required for sending a request to the platform to run a customized application object:

```csharp
AppControl.SendLaunchRequest(appcontrol);
```



**Launch Types(Theory):**

Application can launch with an application control using 2 different launch types:





## Explicit Launch Request

Add to the demo application the ability to run the selected application using the functions considered above. First, add to the manifest file the privilege to use the functions for launching the applications.

```csharp
"http://tizen.org/privilege/appmanager.launch"
```



Make in the click event launch that particular application straightaway, we need to create another dependency service which will tell the tizen side to launch the particular application by passing the appId of the selected application.



Below is code for launching the app for given appId

```csharp
     public void LaunchApp(string appId)
        {
            AppControl control = new AppControl();
            control.Operation = AppControlOperations.Default;
            control.ApplicationId = appId;
            AppControl.SendLaunchRequest(control);
        }

```



Below is the code for handling the click event

```csharp
item.Clicked += Item_Clicked;

private void Item_Clicked(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
          string appId = (sender as CircleToolbarItem).Text;
          DependencyService.Get<IInterface>().LaunchApp(appId);
}

```



After implementing our changes we should be able to launch the selected app:



#V@https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/tizenschool/114/WearableLesson_25.1.mp4#V@



The source code of this tutorial is available [here.](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/tizenschool/114/WearableLesson_25_1.zip)

## Implicit Launch Request

The following example shows how to create an implicit launch request:



To launch a viewer application with a specific operation, URI, and MIME type:

```csharp
AppControl appcontrol = new AppControl();

appcontrol.Operation = AppControlOperations.View;
appcontrol.Mime = "image/*";
appcontrol.Uri = "file:///home/myhome/Photos/1_photo.jpg";

AppControl.SendLauncherRequest(appcontrol);

```



Write a small sample application, demonstrating how to implicitly invoke any application based on our desired purpose, by using the above listed functions. We will try to add a single element to our rotary selector which when clicked should display the exact image we want to see.



Let’s add a single element to our **rotary selector** widget. We will add an element to the **rotary selector.** When we click it, given image will be displayed in Gallary application.



As done previously, add to the manifest file the privilege to use the functions for launching the applications.

```csharp
"http://tizen.org/privilege/appmanager.launch"
```



Then add the single element to our rotary selector widget.

```csharp
   CirclePage circlePage = new CirclePage();
   CircleToolbarItem item = new CircleToolbarItem
   {
         Text = "Tool1",
         SubText = "Select Images",
         Icon = "Default.jpg",
   };
   item.Clicked += Item_Clicked;
   circlePage.ToolbarItems.Add(item);

```



A dependency service is also created in order to tell tizen side to launch our desired application.

```csharp
private void Item_Clicked(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
      DependencyService.Get<IInterface>().LaunchApp();
}

```



Now in the tizen side we decide which application to launch as per our requirements. To display an image we need to set the operation type as _AppControlOperations_ .View and exact image path as _URI_ .

```csharp
public void LaunchApp()
{

		AppControl control = new AppControl();
		control.Operation = AppControlOperations.View;
		control.Uri = Application.Current.DirectoryInfo.SharedResource + "img1.jpg";
		control.LaunchMode = AppControlLaunchMode.Group;
		AppControl.SendLaunchRequest(control);
}

```



Run the application. You will see a single element which when clicked will display the desired image in default gallery app.

# VI. Watch Application

## Watch Application

Let’s start creating the 5th demo application. We will teach you how to create a watch application. We will prepare it for the demo application.



**What is Watch Application?**



Till this lesson, we've been talking about how to create UI applications in your demos, now we'll show you how to create a watch application.



From the name it can be assumed that the application should serve as a time indicator. Still this does not limit the functionality of this application. You can use it as a full-fledged app with interesting additional functions, whether it is a map displayed as a background or some other functional different from watch app. It may seem that there are some serious differences between UI and watch application, but in fact it is not.



The watch application is created in the same way as regular applications with a user interface. There are some differences in creating a base window for the watch app, because it is in a special place in the graphical shell of the device, in the rest, this is usual application. Here you can use the same widgets, services and sensors (GPS, light sensor, etc.), cause the device to vibrate, send notifications and so on.



In the watch application is a limitation on using the bezel and the Back button. In the following lessons, when we move on to the advance topics, we'll show you how to get around this ban by creating an additional window.



**Running Watch Applications**

Unlike UI applications, which you have already created in previous lessons, watch applications do not run right after installation on the device or emulator. On current emulator version 5.0, the watch applications can be set via watch app through long press on watch application or going through settings app.

## Preparing the Watch App for the Demo Application

First, we will create a normal application as discussed in previous lessons. Instead of _FormsApplication_ , we will need _FormsWatchface_ as a base class of our app. _FormsWatchface_ class provides all the necessary functionality to implement watch application.



To catch the change in time we can use the _OnTick()_ method. The _Ontick()_ method is triggered at least once per second. The watch application can get the current time from the **time** handle of the _Tizen.Applications.WatchTime_ class to draw a normal watch. Platform can call this method even in the background state. So even if your watch app is in the background if this method is called, you need to update the UI.



```csharp
protected override void OnTick(TimeEventArgs time)
{
    /// Called at least once per second
    /// Draw a normal watch with the hour, minute, and second info

    base.OnTick(time);
}

```



We will also be using the ambient mode provided to us.



Override the ambient mode methods of the  _Tizen.Applications.WatchApplication_  class to use the ambient mode:



We can then access the _UtcTimestamp_ method of _Watchtime_ class to get the current time. Now the only thing remains is to diplay the time in form of UI.



We can choose to display the time in any manner we desire to. Here we have simply created a _MainPage_ and used _Stack Layout_ , consisting of labels to display the time.

```xml
<StackLayout VerticalOptions="CenterAndExpand">
   <Label
		HorizontalOptions="CenterAndExpand"
		Text="{Binding Mode}"
		VerticalOptions="CenterAndExpand" />
	<Label
		x:Name="TimeLabel"
		FontSize="Large"
		HorizontalOptions="CenterAndExpand"
		Text="{Binding Time, StringFormat='{0:hh\\:mm\\:ss}'}"
		VerticalOptions="CenterAndExpand" />
</StackLayout>
```



Let’s install and run this application and see what happens.



<img src="/assets/images/tutorials/114/lesson_26_image001.png" style="height:520px; width:492px"/>



#V@https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/tizenschool/114/WearableLesson_26.mp4#V@



The full code of this example is available for downloading [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/tizenschool/114/WearableLesson_26.zip).

# V. App Preferences

## Module Description

Now knowing what  **App Preferences**  is, let’s look at how to integrate this feature into our applications.



We will create an application which displays last set Name and age of a person. By clicking the change button, you can change the name and age of person. The last set data will be stored by using preference API and on application restart same data can be fetched.



Below is the class to maintain the data.

```csharp
public class MyData
{
	public string Name { get; set; }
	public int Age { get; set; }
}

```



For simplicity we have maintained a list of only 4 people.

```csharp
List<MyData> personData = new List<MyData>();

for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++)
     personData.Add(new MyData() { Name = "Name_" + i, Age = 20 + i });

```



Once the application is launched, we can change the name & age by clicking the change button.

We need to maintain a unique key which will store the currently selected index.

```csharp
private const string PREF_KEY = "org.tizen.myApp.myKey";
```

<br/> 

Preference APIs are platform specific, so we need to use dependency service to access the APIs

```csharp
public T GetPreference<T>(string key)
{
 //Returns the last saved data for given key
	return Preference.Get<T>(key);
}

public bool ContainsPreference(string key)
{
 //Returns true if the key was saved even once else false
	return Preference.Contains(key);
}

public void SetPreference(string key, object value)
{
 // Save the data for given key
	Preference.Set(key, value);
}

```



Below code is used to get the last saved index

```csharp
if (DependencyService.Get<IInterface>().ContainsPreference(PREF_KEY))
        selectedIndex= DependencyService.Get<IInterface>().GetPreference<int>(PREF_KEY);

```



This is how our application looks.

Project with source code is available [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/tizenschool/114/WearableLesson_27.zip).

## Saving the Data

In this lesson, we will consider the necessity to save small sets of simple data between application restarts, by using the  **App Preference** module.



Using  **App Preference**  you may save information about the currently selected application, so when changing the app settings and return it back, the application will be loaded with the preferences, which was set during the last session.



**Module Description**

As it was already mentioned, this module is mainly used to save application settings (a small set of data). In general, if necessary, you can store any data.



If you have several variables, values of which you want to save till the next application launch, there is no need to open the file for storing these values, and then open and read them. Using databases is not rational as well. All these options, requires implementing some functionality, and as a result spending additional time on it. Using the  **App Preference** , you simply call the function to save the value, or the function to load a value. What can be easier? The value is stored in the operating system with reference to the package name of your application, registered in the manifest file, and the key that you specify for storing the variable. For example, if in your package, there are a service application and a ui application, then you can access same data from both of them. Another advantage is a possibility to create handlers for events of changing the variable, which are stored with the specified key.
