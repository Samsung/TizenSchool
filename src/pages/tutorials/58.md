title: "Piano Native App with EDC"
description: "Complex layouts when unified with the code for functionality can seem a bit twisted even for the simplest changes.\n\nWith a plain text file, called EDC, we split the entire app into two parts. One for design, and one for logic. We take on one of the sample apps on the Tizen SDK to explain just that along with gestures, multitouch, and sounds."
