## 4. Setting up Serial communication

To set up WiFi on Raspberry Pi3, you need to connect PC and Raspberry Pi3 using serial communication.

To make serial communication with Raspberry Pi3, <br/>1. Connect a serial port on the board to PC <br/>2. Launch a serial terminal(Putty) <br/>3. Log in from the serial terminal

<img src="/TizenSchool/assets/images/tutorials/131/page5_1_1195.png" style="undefined"/>

The following steps are required.

**1. Install the serial port (PL2303) driver**

Install the driver of the serial port that connects Raspberry Pi3 and PC. Since this guide is using PL2303 serial port, download and install the PL2303 driver.

<img src="/TizenSchool/assets/images/tutorials/137/page5_2.png" style="height:381px; width:500px"/>

Download the PL2303 Windows Driver [[Link]](http://www.prolific.com.tw/US/ShowProduct.aspx?p_id=225&pcid=41))

**2. Install the serial terminal (PuTTY)**

Install the serial terminal for communicating with the board through the connected serial port to the PC. Download and install the PuTTY program.

<img src="/TizenSchool/assets/images/tutorials/137/page5_3.png" style="height:387px; width:495px"/>

PuTTY download site [[link]](https://www.putty.org/)

**3. Connect Raspberry Pi3 to Serial Port (PL2303**

In order to connect Raspberry Pi3 to the serial port, you need to understand the simple serial communication. Please refer to the links for more information about serial communication. [SERIAL COMMUNICATION](http://www.hardcopyworld.com/gnuboard5/bbs/board.php?bo_table=lecture_pract&wr_id=93)

A serial bus usually consists of two lines. One is for transmission (TX-Transmitter) and the other is for reception (RX-Receiver). All modules that use serial communication have these two pins.

<img src="/TizenSchool/assets/images/tutorials/137/page5_4.png" style="undefined"/>

As shown in the picture above, Raspberry Pi3 and PL2303 serial ports have these two pins. RX, TX are the role names they are responsible for. Therefore, when connecting two devices, they should be connected as TX-RX and RX-TX as shown above.

_UART Board RXD ↔ RPi3 TXD(8pin)<br/>UART Board TXD ↔ RPi3 RXD(10pin)_

VCC of PL2303 is a pin that can receive power through USB when power can not be connected. In this guide, VCC pin is not used because power is supplied separately. GND shoud be connected to GND pin of Raspberry Pi3.

_UART Board GND ↔ RPi3 Ground(6pint)_

When the pin connection is completed, plug the serial port into the USB port of the PC.

**4. Set up the serial terminal(PuTTY)**

**<img src="/TizenSchool/assets/images/tutorials/137/page5_5.png" style="height:365px; width:748px"/>**

Open the [Device Manager] to find the port number of the USB Serial Port as shown in the figure above. If the serial port is not recognized, please check again that the serial port driver is properly installed.

Enter the serial number in PuTTY Configuration and click [Open] to open the serial terminal.

**5. Raspberry Pi3 Log in**

**<img src="/TizenSchool/assets/images/tutorials/137/page5_6.png" style="height:418px; width:661px"/>**

When the Raspberry Pi3 booting is complated, the login propmt is displayed. Please log in using following ID and password. (User ID: root / Password: tizen)

<br/>Once you log in, you can finally communicate with Raspberry Pi3 via the serial terminal.

## 5. Set up WiFi

You can set the WiFi of Raspberry Pi3 through the serial terminal (PuTTY).

**1. Connecting to WiFi with wifi_manager_test**

```bash
$ wifi_manager_test
```

When you enter 'wifi_manager_test' command from the serial terminal, the following screen will appear where you can set the WiFi environment.

<img src="/TizenSchool/assets/images/tutorials/137/page6_1.png" style="height:470px; width:426px"/>

Type “1> 3> c” to connect WiFi.

```bash
1. Wi-Fi Init and set callbacks
3. Activate Wi-Fi device
c. Connect (enter AP name/password)
```

<img src="/TizenSchool/assets/images/tutorials/137/page6_2.png" style="height:680px; width:674px"/>

Enter “6” to confirm that you are connected to the network.

```bash
6. Get connection state
```

Enter “0” to end the WiFi connection setup.

```bash
0. Exit
```

If there is a problem during connection setup, press “0” to exit connection setup. Run wifi_manager_test again to connect WiFi again.

**2. Check the IP address of the connected WiFi**

```bash
$ ifconfig
```

<img src="/TizenSchool/assets/images/tutorials/137/page6_3.png" style="height:362px; width:513px"/>

When WiFi is connected, Raspberry Pi3 will have a unique IP address. It’s possible to connect directly to the device with an IP address.<br/>We will use the IP address of Raspberry Pi3 when connecting to SDB.

## 6. Connect Tizen Studio to RPI3

Tizen Studio and Raspberry Pi3 can be connected using SDB. You can install your projects to Raspberry Pi3 using SDB in Tizen Studio.

SDB is installed in <TIZEN_STUDIO> / tools / when you install the Tizen studio, but you need simple setup to use SDB conveniently. Please refer to Appendix.

**1. Connecting SDB**

As mentioned above, when connecting to a wireless network, Raspberry Pi3 will have a unique IP address.

Raspberry Pi3 and Tizen Studio can be connected using the sdb connect command. In the PC’s command prompt (CMD), enter the following command to connect Raspberry Pi3.

```bash
$ sdb connect <IP address of Raspberry Pi3>

```

<img src="/TizenSchool/assets/images/tutorials/137/page7_1.png" style="height:56px; width:483px"/>

Notice

If the connection is successful, information of Raspberry Pi3 will be displayed in the Device Manager of the Target Studio.

<img src="/TizenSchool/assets/images/tutorials/137/page7_2.png" style="height:537px; width:750px"/>

If the connection is not working properly, try the following steps.

```bash
$ sdb devices
```

<img src="/TizenSchool/assets/images/tutorials/137/page7_3.png" style="height:58px; width:483px"/>

```bash
$ sdb kill-server
```

**2. Run the SDB shell**

To run a sdb shell, run "sdb shell" command at the command prompt (CMD).<br/>The "sdb shell" can be run when there is any device connected with sdb. So after checking whether if there is any devices connected with sdb using "sdb device", please run "sdb shell".

```bash
$ sdb devices
$ sdb shell
```

There are two ways to run the shell with root privileges.

```bash
$ sdb root on
$ sdb shell
```

```bash
$ sdb shell
$ su
Password : tizen (Password is not shown when typing password)
```

<img src="/TizenSchool/assets/images/tutorials/137/page7_4.png" style="height:333px; width:618px"/>

## \* Appendix

**Setting the SDB environment variable**

If Raspberry pi3 has an IP, it can communicate with PC using the IP.<br/>You can make SDB communication via Terminal in Ubuntu or Command Prompt (CMD) in Window.

**1. Running SDB**

SDB is installed under <TIZEN_STUDIO> / tools / when Tizen Studio is installed.

```bash
$ cd <TIZEN_STUDIO>/tools/
$ sdb
```

You can run sdb from the above path.

**2. Set the SDB environment variable**

To make sdb more convenient, set sdb as an environment variable. If you set sdb as an environment variable, you can use sdb anywhere without specifying the path.

**Windows**

```bash
1. Right-click on My Computer> Properties> [Advanced System Settings]
2. Select Environment Variable
3. Select the path of the system variable and click [Edit]
4. Add "C:\tizen-studio\tools" to the Path
5. Redo the terminal or command prompt (CMD)
```

**Ubuntu**

```bash
1. vi ~ / .bashrc
2. Add "export PATH = ~ / tizen-studio / tools: $ PATH" to the bottom of ~ / .bashrc
3. Apply changes with source ~ / .bashrc command
```
