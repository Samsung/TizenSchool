# Overview

## Overview

This tutorial explains how to use Tizen Peripheral GPIO C# API. [GPIO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_input/output) stands for General-Purpose Input/Output, which allows to get access to digital pins in both directions, either input or output.

The application simulates traffic lights used at road intersections. It has three color lights (red, yellow and green), which allows or prohibits traffic to pass intersection. In our application, when the button is pressed, the light are changing from red to green and vice-versa.

## Requirements

To make use of this tutorial, it is required to be familiar with C# basics as well as having a configured environment ([Getting started with Raspberry PI 3&4](https://tizenschool.org/tutorial/191/contents/1)).

Hardware Requirements:

Software Requirements:

Tizen:

## Circuit

Let's start with connecting all devices and elements on the breadbord to the Raspberry Pi.

The way the pin of GPIO23 is connected to the 3V3 and the ground is described here: [pull-up resistor](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Pull-up_resistor).

# Implementation

## Implementation

The application is a Service Tizen App, created with Visual Studio project wizard. In addition to the automatically generated files, it contains 3 more:

## Button.cs

The `Button` class represents the GPIO input device - push button.

## Light.cs

The _Light_  class represents the GPIO output device - LED.

## TrafficLights.cs

The _TrafficLights_  class represents the switchable set of lights simulating traffic lights.

## TrafficLights_App.cs

The last step is to create the _TrafficLights_  object and use it in the application.

The _TrafficLights_App.cs_ file contains the _App_  class which controls the application's life cycle.

# Verification

## Verification

The result can be observed on the breadboard after starting the application (ensure thet RPI is connected via SDB according to the [Getting started with Raspberry PI 3&4](https://tizenschool.org/tutorial/191/contents/1)).

Pushing the button should switch lights in following order:
